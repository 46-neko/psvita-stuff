# psvita-stuff
Some PSVita stuff I did for learning the VitaSDK. Enjoy (I guess, lol)

## Prerequisites

You NEED to have the VitaSDK installed. You can do that on [this link](https://vitasdk.org/).

## Building

You can build by running `cmake . && make` on the directory of the homebrew you want to build.

## Running the Homebrew

After building, just transfer the `.vpk` file to your PSVita and install it. Then you can run it by clicking on the bubble like any other homebrew.
